# twice_the_tip

  

This app will modify the tip on **Seamless** when you press its button using the following criteria:

- If it is currently $0, make it at least $4
- If it is set, double it
- If the doubled amount is higher than the maximum tip, give the maximum tip in the dropdown


Click the button on the top right when you have a Seamless page open to activate.
